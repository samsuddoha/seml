                  <hr>

                  <p>The research project <em>Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection and Employment</em> aims to explore 
                     the intersection of autism and employment by developing innovative technologies and methods for 
                     detecting and identifying individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and improving their
                      access to employment opportunities. 
                     The project involves multiple stages of research, including developing and testing new methods for 
                     detecting ASD, and exploring the best ways to support individuals with ASD in finding and maintaining 
                     employment. The project also aims to raise awareness about the challenges faced by individuals with ASD 
                     in the workplace, and to promote greater understanding and acceptance of autism in society.

                  <p>
                     This project aims to develop methods and techniques to identify false or misleading information on various platforms, including social media, news websites, and other online sources. 
                     Fake news has become a significant issue in recent years, as the spread of false information can have serious consequences, including social, political, and economic implications. The goal of the "Fake news detection" research project is to address this issue by developing innovative technologies and methods for detecting and identifying fake news, with the aim of reducing its impact on society.
                     <br>
                     The project involves multiple stages of research, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Researchers may use various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to train models to identify fake news based on specific characteristics, such as the language used, the source of the information, and the content itself. They may also use natural language processing techniques to analyze the text and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of false information.
                     This research project has the potential to make a significant impact on society, by helping to reduce the spread of false or misleading information and promoting greater accuracy and transparency in news and media. Through the development of innovative technologies and methods, this research project has the potential to improve the lives of individuals and to make a positive contribution to the wider community.

                     Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data</h5> <hr>

                  <p>
                     The research project focuses on various problems to extract the sentiment of text data posted on social
                      media platforms. Sentiment analysis is an important field of study, as it can provide valuable insights 
                      into public opinion and attitudes towards various topics, products, and services. The results of the sentiment
                       analysis can be used for a variety of applications, including market research, public opinion polling, and 
                       social media monitoring. Businesses can use sentiment analysis to gain insight into customer satisfaction and
                        to identify areas for improvement in their products or services. Governments and organizations can use sentiment
                         analysis to monitor public opinion on various issues and to develop policies and strategies accordingly. <br>
                  The project involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of social media data, including text-based posts and 
                  comments, and classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. Natural Language Processing
                   is used to preprocessing data and different machine learning and deep learning approaches including BERT model.
                    This research project has the potential to make a significant impact in various fields, by providing valuable 
                    insights into public sentiment and attitudes. Through the development of innovative technologies and methods, 
                    this research project has the potential to improve decision-making and enhance the overall understanding of
                     public opinion and sentiment.

                     Similarity Assessment of UML Models</h5> <hr>

                  <p>The research project "Similarity Assessment of UML Models" aims to develop methods and techniques to assess
                      the similarity between Unified Modeling Language (UML) models. UML is a standardized modeling language used in 
                      software engineering to visualize, design, and document software systems. The project involves analyzing UML
                       models and developing algorithms to compare their structural and behavioral similarities. Researchers may use
                        various techniques, such as graph matching and clustering, to identify patterns and relationships between 
                        different UML models. 
                     <br>
                     The goal of the project is to develop a reliable and efficient method to assess the similarity between UML models,
                      which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as software evolution, code reuse, and design validation.
                       The results of the similarity assessment can be used for a variety of applications in software engineering. 
                       For example, software developers can use the similarity assessment to identify and reuse code from existing
                        UML models, saving time and resources in the development process. It can also be used to assess the quality 
                        and consistency of UML models and to identify potential errors or inconsistencies in the design.
                         Through the development of innovative technologies and methods, this research project has the potential to
                          enhance the overall quality of software design and development.

                     Optimized Scheduling Algorithm</h5> <hr>

                  <p>The project involves developing algorithms to optimize the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm by improving the 
                     performance and efficiency of the scheduling process. The researchers may use various optimization techniques 
                     such as priority-based scheduling, preemption, and time-slice optimization to enhance the Round Robin Scheduling
                      Algorithm's capabilities.
                     The optimized Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm has the potential to provide significant benefits to various
                      computing systems. For example, it can help to improve the overall performance of systems by reducing the waiting 
                      time for tasks, minimizing the response time, and ensuring a fair distribution of resources. In addition, it can
                       help to increase the overall throughput of systems by allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently.
